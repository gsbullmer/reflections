When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

This is handy when you are collaborating on a project, work on a project in
multiple locations, or just want a backup of your project. If you intend on
sharing your code, this makes it easier to do so.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might make changes you're not ready to push to your remote repository yet,
or you might be working on something someone else is working on at the same
time. Working on a file that is constantly updating with someone else's changes
is an unnecessary hassle.
